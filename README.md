# Fuzzy ARAS

Fuzzy ARAS is a React project aimed at implementing the Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) method using fuzzy logic. This method is widely used for multi-criteria decision-making processes, helping users make informed choices based on multiple criteria. By incorporating fuzzy logic, this project aims to enhance the accuracy and applicability of the ARAS method in real-world scenarios.
